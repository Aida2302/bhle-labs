// Theoretical questions: why do we need abstraction
// How `traits` in Scala are used?

// It helps encapsulate behavior. It helps decouple software elements. It helps having more self-contained modules.

// Traits are used to share interfaces and fields between classes. They are similar to Java 8â€™s interfaces.
// Classes and objects can extend traits but traits cannot be instantiated and therefore have no parameters.

trait Animal {
  // Is this abstract or concrete (implemented) member?
  // abstract
  def name: String

  // Is this abstract or concrete (implemented) member?
  // abstract
  def makeSound(): String
}

trait Walks {

  // What does this line mean?
  // we inherit from Animal trait, in order to use it's members

  this: Animal =>

  // Is this abstract or concrete (implemented) member?
  // It is an concrete member, extended and implemented from Animal class
  // Why `name` parameter is available here?
  // In constructor we used Animal, all member can be used by Walks
  def walk: String = s"$name is walking"

}


// Can Dog only extend from `Walks`?
// Try to fix Dog, so it extends proper traits
// Implement Dog class so it passes tests
